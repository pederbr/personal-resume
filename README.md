# Personal webpage

## Development

To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The deployment is done automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## About

This is the source code for my personal webpage. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework and [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/), a headless CMS.
